Hey dave, 
I wont be available for the next 2 days. Please make sure you inform the new interns about the tool we have been working on. 
To work on their programming skills, they have been working on some web based networking monitoring tool for fun. Check the file i've uploaded for intern names and roles. 
Please make sure you take down our sub domain.
Regards,
Tom
