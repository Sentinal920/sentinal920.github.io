Hey dave, 
I wont be available for the next 2 days. Please inform the new interns about their roles and assigned work.
Check the file i've uploaded for intern names and roles. They have been working on some web based networking monitoring tool for fun. Please make sure you take down any subdomains they might have created for their tool.
Regards,
Tom
